# mkmake

a simple took to create a Makefile in the current file

## how it works

at the moment is only allow to set two commands, `run` and `dev`, dev should be the "watch mode" such as nodemon version of `run` which is only run once

## how to install

`npm i -g mkmake`

## hot to run

`mkmake`
follow instructions

`make run`
`make dev`

> running `make` will execute the `run` command by default (first in order)
